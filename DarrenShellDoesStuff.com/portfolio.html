	<h1>Darren Shell's Portfolio</h1>

	<h3>
		This is currently my portfolio. I know, not much to show off yet. It is a work in progress, but the biggest thing I have to show off is my website. It was coded from scratch by myself. Hosted and setup
		by yours truly.  Any and all images are my original work. Taken and edited by myself. To show more of what I can do I am building a server to host this site, and I will start a blog with a login to comment
		on the blog. This way I can demonstrate a good amount of the coding I learned.
